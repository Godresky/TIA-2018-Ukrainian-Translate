 USA_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC: "On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorist hijackers flew passenger planes into the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people. Hundreds more died later from illnesses related to the attacks, and perhaps thousands of first responders, cleanup workers, and survivors suffer from long-term effects. In response, President George W. Bush launched the War on Terror, which included a nearly 20-year war in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021 and the 2003–2011 Iraq War. A 2011 military operation in Pakistan led to the killing of Osama bin Laden.\n\nGovernment policy designed to promote affordable housing, widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance, and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve led to the United States housing bubble in 2006, which culminated with the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the Great Recession, the nation's largest economic contraction since the Great Depression. During the crisis, assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value. Barack Obama, the first multiracial president, with African-American ancestry was elected in 2008 amid the crisis, and subsequently passed American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 economic stimulus and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in an attempt to mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis.\n\nRepublican Donald Trump was elected as the 45th president in 2016, a result viewed as one of the biggest political upsets in American history."

 ENG_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC: "Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves. This was the rallying cry of many Britons in the days gone by, but the era of the indomitable Royal Navy projecting power across the globe has long since been over. Save for a few small desolate islands strewn about the forgotten corners of the globe, the British Empire has come to an indisputable end. The spirit of Churchill and Thatcher have been replaced by the ever uncharismatic likes of Prime Minister Theresa May and Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn, leaving an increasingly divided “Nation of Nations” to find its way through the brave new world it finds itself in. Now comes the question on every British mind: What now? This is a dilemma that has been provided many possible answers by Tories, Socialists, and Liberals alike. To some the United Kingdom is a relic of the past, a modern Austria-Hungary not long for the world and only serving to hold down their local region. To others Britain is another part of the Europe that they call home, whether they be urban liberals or one of the many thousands of recent arrivals from all over the continent. Yet others believe that Britain is more than a mere Frankenstein’s monster of Englishmen, Welshmen, and Scots. They believe that Britain is wholly separate from any greater “European” identity and that Britain must return to the global stage not tied down by any foreign interests in Washington or Brussels.\n\nThis crisis of identity has finally come to a head in the form of \"“Brexit”\". Initially a simple referendum proposed as a ploy by then-PM David Cameron to win over Eurosceptic voters in the 2015 Elections, it soon spiraled into the all-encompassing crisis of Theresa May’s administration. The decision by the slim majority of the British public to withdraw from the European Union has revived questions on Scottish and Irish nationalism as well as trade policy, in addition to sending investors into a constant state of uncertainty. May was unlucky enough to have the task of guiding Britain through a turbulent withdrawal, but after poor showings in her recent snap election many even in her own party are beginning to look for an alternative leader. There’s no end in sight and every day that solutions are not being made is another day Britain’s prospects grow darker. Will Britain stagger out of Brexit, or will this be the crisis that spells doom for the fragile union?\n\nMay God save the Queen and God save Britannia, for it's beginning to look like no one else can."
 FRA_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC: "Vive la Republique, Vive la France! ~ That was the cry that kept France, at the very least alive, during the last century. But now, in this new one, in this age of information, France's future seems ever so less certain. In Africa, her influence wavers as West Africa tries it's best to break the shackles of neo-colonialism; Central Africa marches boldly in direct opposition to France, and North Africa is always in some internal struggle, leaving little room for French actions. And that should really be the least of France's problems, seeing how, it has been demoted to practically a third-rate-power, with ever lowering influence, ever lowering chances, and an ever increasing both domestic and foreign opposition. But now that we mention it, let us talk about the dumpster fire that is the French internal scene.\n\nEver since the resignation and death of General de Gaulle in 1970, the political race has intensified dramatically. Admittedly, until Chirac the speed-up was rather moderate, ranging between the Gaullists of d'Estaing, Chirac and Pompidou, and the sometimes triumphant Social-Gaullists of Mitterrand. After the end of Chirac's term in 1995 however, everything came to a head. The successors to Mitterrand started losing elections, the Gaullists of old somewhat literally died out, and the ones to succeed them look nothing like them. The new generation seems to be torn in every direction. The old left, such as the Parti Socialiste, Parti Communiste Francaise and others, have been left without a major political victory for ages; the traditional right, that being the Les Republicains, have also fell out of favor. Their places are being taken over by the social liberal La Republique En Marche of Emmanuel Macron, and the right-wing nationalist Front Nationale of Marine Le Pen. All in all, the political scene has changed quite a lot, always hanging between an extreme, and a perhaps too stretched out center. France's future so far looks bleak, but perhaps decisive action from a skillful enough ruler might just save her? Maybe, just maybe, not simply save her, but make her thrive?"
 GER_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC: "Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007, and co-founding the Eurozone. Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban.\n\nIn the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female chancellor. In 2009 the German government approved a €50 billion stimulus plan. Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the energy transition (Energiewende) for a sustainable energy supply, the Debt Brake for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0. During the 2015 European migrant crisis, the country took in over a million refugees and migrants."

 RAJ_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC: "Vital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic. It has remained a democracy with civil liberties, an active Supreme Court, and a largely independent press. Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1990s, has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing economies, and increased its geopolitical clout. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban; by religious and caste-related violence; by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies; and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India. It has unresolved territorial disputes with China and with Pakistan. India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved."
