The 2016 presidential election was one of the most contentious in American history, with Republican nominee Donald Trump ultimately defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump's presidency has been marked by controversy and divisive policies, including the ongoing investigation into possible collusion with Russia during the election, the travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, and the repeal of certain Obama-era policies.\n\nEconomically, the United States is experiencing growth, but there are concerns about income inequality and the impact of globalization on American workers. The unemployment rate is at 4.1%, the lowest it has been in years, and the stock market is reaching new highs. However, many Americans still struggle with stagnant wages and job insecurity. There are also debates about the impact of trade policies, with some arguing that the US should prioritize domestic industries over international competition, while others advocate for free trade agreements.\n\nGeopolitically, the United States is facing a number of challenges, including conflicts with North Korea, ongoing tensions with Russia, and the ongoing fight against ISIS in the Middle East. The situation in North Korea is particularly tense, with the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, continuing to test missiles and nuclear weapons despite international pressure. The US has responded with a mix of diplomatic efforts, economic sanctions, and military posturing, including joint military exercises with South Korea. Tensions with Russia continue to simmer over allegations of interference in the 2016 election, and the two countries have imposed reciprocal sanctions on each other. In the Middle East, the US is working with local forces to combat ISIS, although the situation remains complex due to the ongoing conflict in Syria and the shifting alliances of various groups in the region.\n\nDomestically, the United States is grappling with a number of social and political issues, including race relations, immigration policies, and healthcare. The Black Lives Matter movement and other groups continue to raise awareness about issues of systemic racism and police brutality, while the Trump administration's decision to rescind the DACA program has sparked debates about immigration policies and the treatment of undocumented immigrants. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains a divisive issue, with Republicans attempting to repeal the law and Democrats pushing for its preservation."

The country has a population of over 51 million people and is the world's 11th largest economy. In recent years, South Korea has faced a range of political, economic, and geopolitical challenges.\n\nIn 2017, South Korea underwent a period of political turmoil following the impeachment and removal from office of its former president, Park Geun-hye. This was the first time a democratically elected president had been removed from office in the country's history. Park was impeached over allegations of corruption, including bribery and abuse of power. Her removal from office sparked widespread protests, both in support of and against her impeachment.\n\nFollowing Park's removal, a snap election was held in May 2017, which saw the election of Moon Jae-in as the new president of South Korea. Moon, a former human rights lawyer and liberal politician, campaigned on a platform of reform and promised to tackle corruption and improve relations with North Korea.\n\nSouth Korea's economy has experienced significant growth in recent decades, transforming it from a poor, war-torn nation to a prosperous, industrialized country.

With a population of over 80 million people, Iran is the second-largest country in the region and has a strategic location at the crossroads of Asia and the Middle East. In recent years, Iran has faced a range of political, economic, and geopolitical challenges.\n\nIn May 2017, Iran held presidential elections, which saw the re-election of the incumbent, President Hassan Rouhani. Rouhani, a moderate reformist, campaigned on a platform of economic reform and closer ties with the international community. His re-election was seen as a victory for the reformist camp in Iran, which favors greater political and social freedoms.\n\nHowever, Rouhani faces challenges from hardliners within Iran's political establishment who are opposed to his moderate policies. In addition, Iran's system of government, which is dominated by religious leaders, limits the power of the president and other elected officials.\n\nIran's economy has faced significant challenges in recent years, including high levels of inflation, high unemployment, and a lack of foreign investment due to international sanctions.

However, the country still faces significant economic challenges, including a lack of foreign investment and high levels of corruption.\n\nIran's relationship with the international community, particularly the United States and its allies, has been a major source of tension in recent years. In 2017, the Trump administration announced that it would withdraw from the JCPOA and reimpose economic sanctions on Iran. This move has been criticized by Iran and its allies, who argue that the JCPOA was a key achievement in regional and international diplomacy.\n\nIn addition to tensions with the United States, Iran is also involved in regional conflicts in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. Iran supports the governments of Syria and Iraq in their fight against ISIS, but is opposed by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, who support rebel groups fighting against the Syrian and Iraqi governments.\n\nIn Yemen, Iran supports the Houthi rebels who are fighting against the Saudi-backed government. This has led to a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, with both sides providing military support to their respective allies.\n\n"

 POL_2018_DESC: "Poland, located in Central Europe, has experienced significant political, economic, and geopolitical changes in recent years. Here is a briefing on the country's recent history from a January 1st, 2018 viewpoint.\n\nThe political history of Poland in recent years is dominated by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party. In 2015, PiS won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections, forming a single-party government led by Prime Minister Beata Szydlo. However, in December 2017, Szydlo resigned and was replaced by Mateusz Morawiecki.\n\nPiS has been criticized for its controversial reforms of the judiciary, media, and civil service, which opponents claim undermine democratic institutions and freedoms. These reforms have led to protests both in Poland and internationally. PiS also supports conservative social policies, including restrictions on abortion and LGBT rights.\n\nPoland has experienced steady economic growth in recent years, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union (EU). According to the European Commission, Poland's GDP growth rate in 2017 was 4.6%, the highest in the EU.\n\nPoland has been successful in attracting foreign investment, particularly in its automotive and manufacturing sectors. The country has also benefitted from EU structural funds, which have been used to improve infrastructure, education, and healthcare.\n\nHowever, there are concerns about the country's high levels of public debt, which reached 55.6% of GDP in 2017. The government has also been criticized for its changes to the pension system, which have been unpopular with some citizens.\n\nPoland's geopolitical position has been shaped by its location between Russia and Western Europe. The country has traditionally had close ties with the United States, and has been a member of NATO since 1999.\n\nIn recent years, Poland has become increasingly critical of the EU, particularly over the issue of migration. The government has opposed EU efforts to resettle refugees in Poland, and has been involved in legal battles with the EU over the issue.\n\nPoland has also had tense relations with Russia, particularly since the annexation of Crimea in 2014. The country has supported sanctions against Russia, and has been involved in efforts to strengthen NATO's presence in the region."
 UKR_2018_DESC: "Ukraine has experienced significant political, economic, and geopolitical changes since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. As of January 1st, 2018, Ukraine is a parliamentary republic with a President as its head of state and a Prime Minister as the head of government. Its political system has undergone several changes, including the 2014 Euromaidan revolution, the annexation of Crimea by Russia, and the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe Euromaidan revolution in 2014 brought about significant political changes in Ukraine. The revolution led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych, who was accused of corruption and of aligning too closely with Russia. Following his ouster, Petro Poroshenko was elected as Ukraine's President in May 2014. The Ukrainian government has since pursued policies to align with the West and to integrate further with the European Union (EU) and NATO. However, the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which began in April 2014, has continued to pose significant challenges for the country.\n\nUkraine is a lower-middle-income country with an economy that has struggled to recover from the global financial crisis of 2008 and the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. The country has been undergoing significant economic reforms aimed at improving its business climate, attracting foreign investment, and boosting economic growth. Some of the key reforms include efforts to tackle corruption, deregulate the economy, and reform the energy sector. Ukraine's economy is heavily reliant on exports, particularly of agricultural products and minerals. The country has also been seeking to diversify its exports and to reduce its dependence on Russia as a trading partner.\n\nUkraine's geopolitical situation has been heavily influenced by its relationship with Russia. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in March 2014 has been a significant factor in Ukraine's recent history, leading to international condemnation and the imposition of sanctions by the EU and the US. The ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine has been fueled by Russia's support for separatist rebels, and has resulted in thousands of deaths and significant destruction. Ukraine has been seeking to strengthen its ties with the West and to join both the EU and NATO. However, these efforts have been met with opposition from Russia, which sees Ukraine's closer alignment with the West as a threat to its own strategic interests."

 NZL_2018_DESC: "New Zealand is a small island nation located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It has a parliamentary system of government and a mixed market economy. Since the start of 2018, New Zealand has seen some significant political, economic, and geopolitical developments.\n\nIn the political sphere, New Zealand saw a major change in government in late 2017. The Labour Party, led by Jacinda Ardern, formed a coalition government with the New Zealand First Party and the Green Party. This marked a shift away from the previous National Party-led government that had been in power for nine years.\n\nUnder the new government, there have been several significant policy changes, including a focus on tackling poverty, increasing investment in healthcare and education, and addressing climate change. The government has also taken steps to address longstanding issues facing the indigenous Māori population, such as improving access to healthcare and housing.\n\nNew Zealand has enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years, with a focus on services, tourism, and agriculture. In 2017, GDP growth was 2.9%, which was higher than the OECD average. However, there have been some challenges, such as rising house prices and concerns over inequality.\n\nIn response, the new government has announced a number of economic policies, including plans to build 100,000 affordable homes, increase the minimum wage, and reform the tax system to make it fairer. The government has also launched a $1 billion regional development fund to support infrastructure projects in underdeveloped areas of the country.\n\nNew Zealand is a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), although the latter has been thrown into doubt after the United States withdrew from the agreement in early 2017. New Zealand has also maintained close relationships with its traditional allies, such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nIn recent years, New Zealand has also increased its engagement with Asia, particularly with China. In 2017, New Zealand signed a bilateral agreement with China to increase trade and investment between the two countries. However, this has raised concerns among some observers, who worry that New Zealand's close relationship with China could undermine its relationships with other key partners, particularly the United States.\n\nIn addition to its relationships with major powers, New Zealand has also taken an active role in promoting global security and stability. In 2017, New Zealand deployed troops to Iraq to assist in the fight against ISIS, and has also contributed to peacekeeping missions in the Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste."

 BEL_2018_DESC: "Belgium is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government. The country is divided into three regions: Flanders in the north, Wallonia in the south, and the Brussels-Capital Region in the center. Each region has its own government and parliament, and the federal government handles matters that affect the entire country.\n\nIn recent years, Belgium has faced several political challenges, particularly in relation to its complex system of government. Following the 2014 federal elections, it took a record-breaking 541 days to form a federal government due to disagreements between the different political parties. However, a new government was eventually formed in 2014, led by Prime Minister Charles Michel.\n\nOne of the main economic challenges facing Belgium is its high public debt, which stood at over 100% of GDP in 2018. The country has also been grappling with a relatively high unemployment rate, particularly in Wallonia. However, the economy has been growing steadily, with a GDP growth rate of 1.7% in 2017.\n\nIn terms of geopolitics, Belgium is an active member of the European Union (EU), NATO, and the United Nations (UN).

In March 2017, the Dutch general election saw the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), led by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, emerge as the largest party, followed by the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the Democrats 66 (D66).

The country has been a destination for refugees and migrants from war-torn countries such as Syria and Afghanistan. The government has faced criticism from some quarters for its handling of the crisis, and there has been debate over issues such as integration, security, and the role of the EU in addressing the crisis."
 IRL_2018_DESC: "Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a president serving as a ceremonial head of state and a prime minister as the head of government. Since January 1st, 2018, the president of Ireland is Michael D. Higgins, and the Taoiseach is Leo Varadkar.\n\nIn the last few years, the Irish economy has been steadily growing, with the unemployment rate reaching a post-crisis low of 5.4% in December 2017. Ireland is a member of the European Union (EU), and its economy is heavily dependent on trade with other EU countries. In December 2017, negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit continued, and the Irish government sought to ensure that the peace process in Northern Ireland would not be undermined by the UK's departure from the EU.\n\nIn political news, in May 2018, Ireland held a referendum on whether to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibited abortion in almost all cases. The referendum resulted in a landslide victory for the repeal campaign, and the government subsequently introduced legislation to allow for abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAnother significant event in Irish politics in recent years was the resignation of Enda Kenny as Taoiseach in June 2017. He was succeeded by Leo Varadkar, who became the first openly gay prime minister in Ireland's history. Varadkar has emphasized the importance of building a more inclusive society and has been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nIn terms of foreign relations, Ireland has maintained close ties with the UK, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland.

 BRA_2018_DESC: "Brazil is the largest country in both South America and Latin America, and has experienced significant political and economic changes in recent years. From a January 1st, 2018 viewpoint, the country is undergoing a period of political uncertainty and economic instability, with a number of high-profile corruption scandals and ongoing social and economic challenges.\n\nIn 2016, Brazil faced one of the biggest political crises in its history, with the impeachment of then-president Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff, who had been re-elected in 2014, was accused of breaking fiscal laws and manipulating the country's budget. Vice President Michel Temer assumed the presidency following Rousseff's impeachment and served out the remainder of her term.\n\nSince then, Brazil has been rocked by a series of corruption scandals that have implicated many of its top politicians and business leaders. The most significant of these is Operation Car Wash, a wide-ranging investigation into corruption at Brazil's state-run oil company, Petrobras. The investigation has resulted in the conviction of dozens of high-profile figures, including former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\nIn 2018, Brazil held presidential elections that saw far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro win the presidency. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, campaigned on a platform of cracking down on crime and corruption, and has been criticized for his controversial comments on issues such as gender and race.\n\nBrazil's economy is the largest in Latin America, but it has struggled with a number of challenges in recent years. In 2015 and 2016, the country experienced a deep recession that saw its GDP contract by more than 7%.

Ethiopia has made significant progress in poverty reduction, human development, and economic growth in recent years.\n\nEthiopia is a federal parliamentary republic with a prime minister as the head of government and a president as the head of state. Ethiopia has a history of political instability, with a state of emergency declared in 2016 following widespread protests against government policies. The government has also been accused of suppressing opposition parties and journalists, and human rights groups have criticized the use of excessive force against protesters.\n\nEthiopia has been one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa in recent years, with an average GDP growth rate of 10.8% between 2010 and 2015. The country has also made progress in poverty reduction, with the poverty rate falling from 44% in 2000 to 23.5% in 2015.

 CAN_2018_DESC: "Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarchy. Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of Canada and is represented by the Governor General, currently Julie Payette. The Prime Minister is Justin Trudeau, leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, who has been in power since 2015.\n\nIn 2018, Canada's political landscape is marked by a number of significant issues. One of the most prominent is the ongoing negotiations surrounding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which is a trade agreement between Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The Trump administration has signaled a desire to renegotiate the agreement, and this has led to a great deal of uncertainty for Canadian businesses and industries that rely on the agreement for trade.\n\nAnother important issue in Canadian politics is the ongoing effort to reconcile with Indigenous peoples in Canada. This includes addressing the legacy of residential schools, which were government-funded, church-run schools that were designed to assimilate Indigenous children into Canadian society. The schools have been described as a form of cultural genocide, and many Indigenous peoples continue to face significant challenges as a result of their experiences in the schools.\n\nIn terms of the economy, Canada is a highly developed country with a strong service sector and significant natural resource wealth. The country is a major exporter of oil, gas, and other natural resources, and these industries play a significant role in the Canadian economy. The government has also made significant investments in areas such as technology and innovation in recent years.\n\nCanada's geopolitical position is largely defined by its relationship with the United States. The two countries share the longest undefended border in the world and have a close economic and cultural relationship. In recent years, however, there has been some strain on this relationship, particularly as a result of the Trump administration's policies on issues such as trade and immigration.\n\nCanada also maintains strong relationships with other countries around the world, particularly other members of the Commonwealth of Nations and NATO. The country has traditionally played a leading role in international peacekeeping efforts and has been involved in a number of major conflicts, including World War I and World War II.\n\nIn terms of domestic politics, the Trudeau government has been focused on issues such as climate change, Indigenous reconciliation, and gender equality. The government has made significant investments in renewable energy and has introduced a carbon pricing scheme in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The government has also taken steps to address gender inequality, including introducing a gender-balanced cabinet and passing legislation to address pay equity."
 PHL_2018_DESC: "From a political standpoint, the Philippines has been experiencing some turbulent times as of late. In 2016, Rodrigo Duterte won the presidential election by a significant margin. He ran on a platform of ending drug abuse and corruption in the government, and since taking office, he has been enacting controversial policies to try and achieve these goals. One of his most notable policies has been his crackdown on drugs, which has resulted in thousands of extrajudicial killings and sparked criticism from human rights groups and foreign governments.\n\nEconomically, the Philippines has been experiencing steady growth in recent years, with a 6.7% GDP growth rate in 2017. This growth has been driven in part by the outsourcing industry, which has become a major source of jobs and revenue for the country. However, the Philippines still faces significant challenges in terms of poverty and inequality, and there are concerns about the country's dependence on remittances from overseas workers.\n\nGeopolitically, the Philippines has been caught in the middle of tensions between the United States and China. The Philippines has traditionally been a close ally of the United States, but Duterte has recently taken steps to improve relations with China. This has led to some concerns about the Philippines' long-term strategic interests, as well as tensions with other countries in the region that have competing territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n\nIn addition to these challenges, the Philippines has also been dealing with natural disasters and other crises. In 2017, the country was hit by a number of powerful typhoons and earthquakes, and there have been ongoing conflicts with Muslim separatist groups in the southern part of the country."

It has a population of approximately 97 million people and is one of the most populous countries in the region.\n\nEgypt's political history has been marked by periods of stability and instability, including coups, revolutions, and changes in government. In 2011, Egypt's long-time ruler, Hosni Mubarak, was ousted from power following mass protests in what became known as the Arab Spring. After his removal, the country was led by the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi, who was democratically elected in 2012. However, his government was short-lived and was overthrown by a military coup in 2013 led by current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Since then, Sisi has been in power and has faced criticism for his authoritarian rule and crackdowns on civil liberties.\n\nEgypt's economy has struggled in recent years due to political instability, high unemployment rates, and a large public debt. In 2016, the government signed a $12 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in an effort to revive the economy. The agreement came with conditions, including economic reforms and austerity measures, which have been met with mixed reactions from the Egyptian people. Since then, there have been some positive signs of economic growth, including an increase in tourism and foreign investment, but there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed, such as high inflation rates and a large informal economy.\n\nEgypt's location at the crossroads of Africa and the Middle East has made it an important player in regional politics. The country has had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel since 1979 and has played a key role in mediating conflicts between Israel and the Palestinians. Egypt has also been involved in the conflict in Syria, supporting the government of Bashar al-Assad. In addition, the country has been a major player in negotiations regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which has been a source of tension between Egypt and Ethiopia due to concerns over water security.\n\nLooking ahead, Egypt's political, economic, and geopolitical challenges are significant, and the country will need to navigate these challenges carefully in order to move towards a more stable and prosperous future."

The Buhari administration has made efforts to diversify the economy, with agriculture, solid minerals, and tourism being the key sectors identified for growth.\n\nNigeria's geopolitical position in Africa is significant. It is the largest economy in West Africa and a leading power in the African Union. The country is also a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and has played a leading role in regional peacekeeping efforts, including in the fight against Boko Haram insurgency in the Northeastern region of the country. Nigeria also plays an important role in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, signed in March 2018, which aims to create a single continental market for goods and services.\n\nNigeria has been facing several challenges that affect its political, economic, and geopolitical stability. In addition to the fall in oil prices, Nigeria also has to contend with corruption, terrorism, and ethnic and religious tensions. Boko Haram insurgency in the Northeast region of the country has caused significant social and economic disruption, leading to the displacement of over 2 million people. The government has also been criticized for its response to the humanitarian crisis in the region.\n\nIn conclusion, Nigeria has been making significant strides in its political, economic, and geopolitical landscape. However, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed for the country to realize its potential as a leading power in Africa and the global community."
