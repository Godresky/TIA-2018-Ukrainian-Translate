 radio_detection_desc:0 "A parabolic antenna is an antenna that uses a parabolic reflector, a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. The main advantage of a parabolic antenna is that it has high directivity. It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a narrow beam or receive radio waves from one direction only."
 decimetric_radar:0 "High Gain Antennas"
 decimetric_radar_desc:0 "In electromagnetics, an antenna's power gain or simply gain is a key performance number which combines the antenna's directivity and electrical efficiency. In a transmitting antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts input power into radio waves headed in a specified direction. In a receiving antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts radio waves arriving from a specified direction into electrical power."

 centimetric_radar:0 "Modern Phased Array Radar"
 centimetric_radar_desc:0 "In antenna theory, a phased array usually means an electronically scanned array, a computer-controlled array of antennas which creates a beam of radio waves that can be electronically steered to point in different directions without moving the antennas. In an array antenna, the radio frequency current from the transmitter is fed to the individual antennas with the correct phase relationship so that the radio waves from the separate antennas add together to increase the radiation in a desired direction, while cancelling to suppress radiation in undesired directions."
 improved_centimetric_radar:0 "Improved Phased Array Radar"
 improved_centimetric_radar_desc:0 "Phased array radar systems are useful for warships in many situations.

 basic_quantum_radar_desc:0 "Quantum radar is an emerging remote-sensing technology based on input quantum correlations and output quantum detections. If it is successfully developed, it will allow the radar system to pick out its own signal even when swamped by background noise. This allows it to detect stealth aircraft, filter out deliberate jamming attempts, and operate in areas of high background noise."

 mechanical_computing:0 "Reduced Instruction Set Processors"
 mechanical_computing_desc:0 "A reduced instruction set computer, or RISC, is one whose instruction set architecture (ISA) allows it to have fewer cycles per instruction (CPI) than a complex instruction set computer (CISC). For any given level of general performance, a RISC chip will typically have far fewer transistors dedicated to the core logic which originally allowed designers to increase the size of the register set and increase internal parallelism."
 computing_machine:0 "Multi-Core Processors"
 computing_machine_desc:0 "A multi-core processor is a computer processor integrated circuit with two or more separate processing units, called cores, each of which reads and executes program instructions, as if the computer had several processors. The instructions are ordinary CPU instructions, but the single processor can run instructions on separate cores at the same time, increasing overall speed for programs that support multithreading or other parallel computing techniques."
 improved_computing_machine:0 "Improved Multi-Core Processors"

Another aspect which is useful for those concerned with security, quantum cryptography presents a great boon and threat to digital protection."
 basic_encryption:1 "Encryption - Public-Key Cryptography"
 basic_encryption_desc:0 "Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner. The generation of such keys depends on cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems to produce one-way functions. Effective security only requires keeping the private key private; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security."
 improved_encryption:1 "Encryption - Hash Functions"
 improved_encryption_desc:0 "A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size onto data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. Hash functions are often used in combination with a hash table, a common data structure used in computer software for rapid data lookup. Hash functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file."
 advanced_encryption:1 "Encryption - Modern Implementation of AES"
 advanced_encryption_desc:0 "The Advanced Encryption Standard, also known by its original name Rijndael, is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. AES is based on a design principle known as a substitution–permutation network and is efficient in both software and hardware. Unlike its predecessor DES, AES does not use a Feistel network. AES is a variant of Rijndael which has a fixed block size of 128 bits, and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits."
 near_future_encryption:1 "Encryption - Device-Independent Quantum Cryptography"
 near_future_encryption_desc:0 "A quantum cryptographic protocol is device-independent if its security does not rely on trusting that the quantum devices used are truthful. Thus, the security analysis of such a protocol needs to consider scenarios of imperfect or even malicious devices. Several important problems have been shown to admit unconditional secure and device-independent protocols."
 future_encryption:1 "Encryption - Post-Quantum Cryptography"
 future_encryption_desc:0 "Post-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms (usually public-key algorithms) that are thought to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. The problem with currently popular algorithms is that their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems: the integer factorization problem, the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm."
 basic_decryption:1 "Decryption - Public-Key Cryptography"
 basic_decryption_desc:0 "A potential security vulnerability in using asymmetric keys is the possibility of a "man-in-the-middle" attack, in which the communication of public keys is intercepted by a third party and then modified to provide different public keys instead. Encrypted messages and responses must also be intercepted, decrypted, and re-encrypted by the attacker using the correct public keys for different communication segments, in all instances, so as to avoid suspicion."
 improved_decryption:1 "Decryption - Hash Attacks"
 improved_decryption_desc:0 "There is a long list of cryptographic hash functions, but many have been found to be vulnerable and should not be used. Many cryptographic hashes are based on the Merkle–Damgård construction. All cryptographic hashes that directly use the full output of a Merkle–Damgård construction are vulnerable against length extension attacks. This makes the MD5, SHA-1, RIPEMD-160, Whirlpool and the SHA-256 / SHA-512 hash algorithms all vulnerable against this specific attack."
 advanced_decryption:1 "Decryption - AES Side-Channel Attacks"
 advanced_decryption_desc:0 "Side-channel attacks do not attack the cipher as a black box, and thus are not related to cipher security as defined in the classical context but are important in practice. They attack implementations of the cipher on hardware or software systems that inadvertently leak data. Due to the accepted reality that AES is unbreakable, this is the primary mode of attack against it."
 near_future_decryption:1 "Decryption - Hypothetical Quantum Security Attacks"
 near_future_decryption_desc:0 "A rise in quantum encryption calls for advances in respective decryption. By modifying age-old methods, and developing uniquely quantum attacks, the balance of security will remain uncertain."
 future_decryption:1 "Decryption - Post-Quantum Security Research"
 future_decryption_desc:0 "In cryptography research, it is desirable to prove the equivalence of a cryptographic algorithm and a known hard mathematical problem. These proofs are often called "security reductions” and are used to demonstrate the difficulty of cracking the encryption algorithm. In other words, the security of a given cryptographic algorithm is reduced to the security of a known hard problem. Researchers are actively looking for security reductions in the prospects for post quantum cryptography."
