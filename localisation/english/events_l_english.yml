 myanmar.1.d: "Calling the recent elections in which Aung San Suu Kyi's NLD was re-elected to power rigged, Tatmadaw commander Min Aung Hlaing today led a coup that ousted the government and took control of all vital buildings in Naypyidaw. Despite most government officials being arrested, several NLD lawmakers have fled the country and established a government in exile. With the new government breaking the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement with the various ethnic separatist armies in our nation, it is likely that our nation will be thrown into civil war once more."

The new junta is reported to be friendly with the People's Republic of China, and has broken the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement with the various ethnic separatist armies in the country.

The Turkish investigation concluded that Khashoggi had been strangled as soon as he entered the consulate building, and that his body was dismembered and disposed of.

The end of the conflict against the Taliban is an important step towards ending the instability that has plagued the nation ever since the Soviet-backed overthrow of President Mohammed Daoud Khan in 1978. The news is also a relief to the relatives of the many victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001, as the Taliban actively aided the perpetrators."
